# Women-Cloth-Reviews-Prediction-with-Multi-Nomial-Na-ve-Bayes
This project analyzes and classifies women's clothing reviews from an e-commerce platform using machine learning techniques. The objective is to predict product ratings based on customer reviews.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and text data cleaning.
- **Text Vectorization:** Using CountVectorizer for text feature extraction.
- **Classification Models:** Implementing Multinomial Naive Bayes for rating predictions.
- **Model Evaluation:** Confusion matrix and classification report for performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Data Source:** Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews dataset

## Results
- Initial Multiclass Classification Accuracy: 38%
- Binary Classification (Poor/Good): Accuracy 67%
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic approach to text classification using Naive Bayes and provides insights into improving customer feedback systems for e-commerce platforms.
